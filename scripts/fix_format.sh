  # run dart or flutter "pub get" yet.
  #
  # Running "dart pub get" is not a NECESSARY thing for the formatting to work
  # (dart format is entirely AST-based), but if someone runs the formatting
  # script locally, then we don't want confusion about the warnings if they
  # haven't run "dart pub get" (which is equivalent to "flutter pub get" if the
  # dart executable is in a Flutter SDK directory).
  #
  # In CI, we want to be able to only install the lightweight Dart image, not
  # the much heavier Flutter image, which quadruples the time it takes to run
  # the formatting check. In that case, since the dart executable isn't part of
  # a Flutter SDK directory, "dart pub get" will give errors about the monorepo
  # depending on Flutter and not running "flutter pub get", so we want to
  # suppress that failure here so it doesn't cause the fix_format.sh script to
  # exit.
  #
  # Whether that resolution succeeded DOES change the formatting, so we pin the
  # language version below rather than letting it vary. With a package config,
  # "dart format" uses the language version the pubspec declares; without one it
  # falls back to the newest version the SDK supports, and the two disagree on
  # constructs like method chains. That is how CI and a contributor on the same
  # SDK can reach opposite conclusions about the same file. Every package in the
  # formatted paths declares sdk ">=3.10.0", matching the monorepo workspace, so
  # 3.10 reproduces a resolved local run. Bump it when those pubspecs raise
  # their floor.
